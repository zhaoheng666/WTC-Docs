Are you referring to the continuous loading issue with our Canvas application? 

After investigation, we discovered that due to differences in network conditions and the increase in application content, some users in specific regions may experience extended loading times. Although users are eventually able to fully load and successfully access the application's features, we understand that this can result in a poor experience.

To address this issue, we are implementing a comprehensive optimization plan. We assure you that we are committed to improving this situation; however, internally, these plans will take some time to implement as it is not an easy problem to resolve.

We kindly request exemption from this issue during the current review process, allowing us to continue operating the application while we diligently implement the necessary optimizations according to the plan.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Dear Reviewer,

I am unable to understand why the URL needs to be updated and how we should update it, https://apps.facebook.com/doublexcasino/

I have provided screenshots to show you our URL settings and the page the URL points to, demonstrating that we haven't found any issues.

We hope you can provide us with further explanation and guidance to help us resolve this violation.

### 回复内容：

Our application uses the Graph API solely to retrieve user profile pictures and to access the 'invite friends' feature. These features are located in the top left corner of the application's main lobby interface. I have provided screenshots for your review. Additionally, is there anything else you require us to clarify?
